# TODO:
- look how to do operations modulo a prime
- do primality testing, prime factorisation, find divisors both for single n and for all n <= N
- binomial coefficient module a prime??
- COMBINATRONICS example with DP
- Exponentation quickly using matrices

# TIPS:
- set difference, counting problem is easier if you group the expression in a different way
- need to understand what it means to prime factorise
- rest are combinatorial DP
