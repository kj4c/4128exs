# TODO:
- learn more about what min cut actually means vs max flow
- project selection, image segmentation
- power transmission, magic potion (flow graph construction)
- delivery bears (binary searching)
- oil skimming (bipartite)

# TIPS:
optimisation problems (wadatmean)
if they dont allow a greedy or DP solution then use flow, this is noticable when you there is no useful order.

know how to construct multiple sources & sinks
doing two direction for undirected graphs
bipartite matching

MINCUT = MAX FLOW
