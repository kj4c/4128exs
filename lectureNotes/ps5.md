# TODO:


# TIPS:
- need to know single source shortest path
unweighted: BFS
non-negative weights: dijkstra
negative weight, find negative cycles: bellman-ford

all pairs shortest path: floyd-warshall

Jzzhu & Cities, President's path
jzzhu shows how to manipulate dijkstra algo
president's path shows how to manipulate floyd-warshall
